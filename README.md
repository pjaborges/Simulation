# Simulation
A library to perform simulation and is in a early stage of development.
It can simulate many jobs in one single machine or in several.
There are no precedence between the machines.
It is also implemented three priority queues (Low, Medium and High).
The usage of these priority queues can be set or unset.
Jobs with higher priority are processed first.
Additionally, only the FIFO dispatch rule is employed in the queues.

It uses the repository Parameters which can be found in pjaborges/Parameters.
